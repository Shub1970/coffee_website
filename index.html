      Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of
      berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee
      fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted
      green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them
      into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine
      particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered
      out, producing a cup of coffee. Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly
      acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its
      caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4]
      and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso,
      French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually
      served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar
      substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or
      enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet
      dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared
      coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop (not to be
      confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).

    <h2>French Coffee</h2>
    <img src="images/french-tost.jpg" alt="french-tost" />
    <p style="width: 75%">
      French coffee is a culture. It's how the French drink and enjoy their
      coffee instead of what they're actually drinking in their cup. Many coffee
      aficionados regard French coffee as slightly bitter, made from nothing
      more than average beans. But the taste, flavor, and preparation have
      little to do with what it is. French coffee is about the experience —
      sitting in a sidewalk café, watching people and watching the world go by
      as you relax and enjoy a hot, strong cup.

    <h2>Colombian coffee</h2>

    <p style="width: 75%">
      Coffee production in Colombia has a reputation for producing mild,
      well-balanced coffee beans.[1][2][3][4] Colombia's average annual coffee
      production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world,
      after Brazil and Vietnam, though highest in terms of the arabica
      bean.[5][6][7][8] The beans are exported to United States, Germany,
      France, Japan, and Italy.[9] Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee
      growing axis region, while other regions focus on quality instead of
      volumes, such as Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. In 2007, the European Union
      granted Colombian coffee a protected designation of origin status.[10] In
      2011, UNESCO declared the "Coffee Cultural Landscape" of Colombia, a World
      Heritage site.[11]
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="width: 75%">
      The coffee plant had spread to Colombia by 1790.[12] The oldest written
      testimony of the presence of coffee in Colombia is attributed to a Jesuit
      priest, José Gumilla. In his book The Orinoco Illustrated (1730), he
      registered the presence of coffee in the mission of Saint Teresa of
      Tabajé, near where the Meta river empties into the Orinoco. Further
      testimony comes from the archbishop-viceroy Caballero y Gongora (1787) who
      registered the presence of the crop in the north east of the country near
      Giron (Santander) and Muzo (Boyaca) in a report that he provided to the
      Spanish authorities.
