    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <img src="./images/ourroster.PNG" width="100%" alt="our roster">
    <p style="width: 100%">
      When we started roasting in 2013, we had a small 1kg machine that had us
      roasting for twelve to fourteen hours straight on most nights because of
      how small it was. Though we have grown, in the size of our roasting
      machines (we now roast on two 12kg and one 25kg Probat machines), and the
      team of roasters, we continue to spend as much time, energy and resources
      on constantly pushing our roasting quality forward. We are consistently
      researching, testing and implementing best practices throughout our
      business to raise the bar. Evaluating hundreds of green bean samples by
      cupping them every harvest season, before making our final selections is
      standard procedure at Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters. Conducting advanced
      sensory trainings for our roasters, and experimenting with processing
      methods at the farm level are just some of the ways that our highly
      skilled team is constantly evolving. Although we have a dedicated sourcing
      team for green beans and have invested in establishing quality roasting
      parameters, we know that a lot more steps still have to fall into place to
      brew a good cup. This is why we work closely with our Q-Grade certified
      Director of Coffee to create industry leading procedures such as cupping
      every single batch that is roasted to ensure consistent quality. Our
      belief in transparency extends to our roasteries in Gurgaon, Mumbai and
      Bangalore, and we encourage our customers to visit us. To take the
      interaction with your coffee a level further, we will soon be running
      on-going tours of the roastery. We roast from Monday to Friday and look
      forward to having you drop by to see some of your favourite beans being
      roasted

        Our mission since we started has stayed simple: introduce our customers to the estates we directly buy our great tasting coffee from, roast the beans with care, and make high quality coffee more accessible through our cafes and our website. The coffee we roast is the coffee we like to drink, and we hope you like it too. 

<h3>At Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters, we follow a simple set of beliefs.</h3>

Transparency is much more than just where we get our beans from.
The first thing we did when we started our
 company was to highlight our award winning farms. This idea of transparency organically evolved to the way we worked in other areas too - our baristas are always present to discuss brewing tips, our customer service team are there to walk you through your coffee questions, and our roasting team to show you how they work.

<h3>A culture of constant learning is the key to always pushing coffee forward.</h3>
We are consistently researching, testing and 
implementing best practices throughout our busin
ess to raise the bar. Making refractometers essential for
our cafe brewing, holding advanced sensory learnings for junior roasters, and experimenting with processing at the farm level are just some of the ways that our highly skilled team is constantly evolving the way Indian coffee is treated, experienced or communicated about.
